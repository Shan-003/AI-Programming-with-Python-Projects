Project 1 : Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds  
In this project we had 3 main objectives:  
Classifies pet images using pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) models and Python skill 
Compares these classifications to the true identity of the pets in the images,  
Summarizes how well the CNN performed on the image classification task
